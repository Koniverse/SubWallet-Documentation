# Start staking

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet web dashboard and choose the Earning tab on the sidebar.

**Step 2**: In the Earning section, you will see a list of available protocols.&#x20;

Since you want to stake for **Parallel liquid staking**, click on the "Stake now" button of the Parallel Liquid Staking protocol.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have previously staked for certain protocols, when you choose the Earning tab on the sidebar, the screen will be displayed in the following manner. Don't worry, just simply click on the "+" icon or **Add more fund** button to access the same screen as the picture above.

{% endhint %}

**Step 3**: You will be directed to the Earn screen.&#x20;

On the right panel, the steps involved in the process are listed clearly for you to see. After completing each step, you will be automatically directed to the next step.

{% hint style="info" %}
The steps of the process also depend on whether you have enough DOT on Parallel to cover the minimum active stake.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Step 4**: To begin the process, please enter the required staking information.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are in all-accounts mode like the current example, you would need to choose the staking account.&#x20;

If you have already been in a single account mode, you would not have to select the account. The screen would be as the following image:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (625).png>)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Please make sure that the amount you want to stake is at least equal to or greater than the minimum staking required. For **Parallel liquid staking**, the minimum active stake is 1 DOT.

Please keep in mind that each network has regulations regarding the **existential deposit** **(ED)**. When selecting the stake amount, it is important to ensure that the balance (after reducing the stake amount and stake fee) is equal to or greater than **ED**.
{% endhint %}

An example of a complete input for staking would be the following image.&#x20;

In this case, since we don't have enough DOT on Parallel to cover the minimum active stake, we need to transfer DOT from Polkadot network to Parallel network. You may notice that on the right panel of the screen, Step 2 has changed to "Transfer DOT from Polkadot".

Please click "Submit" to continue.

**Step 5**: Click "Approve" to proceed.

**Step 6**: You have successfully transferred your DOT from Polkadot to Parallel!

Now choose "Continue" to mint your sDOT.
