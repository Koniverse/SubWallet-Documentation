**Step 2**: In the Earning section, you will see a list of available protocols.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To view more information related to staking such as reward distribution, minimum active stake, minimum redeem, APY,... you can follow this[ instruction](../earning-information.md).
{% endhint %}

Since you want to stake for **Acala liquid staking**, click on the "Stake now" button of the Acala Liquid Staking protocol.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have previously staked for certain protocols, when you choose the **Earning tab** on the sidebar, the screen will be displayed in the following manner. Don't worry, just simply click on the "+" icon or "Add more fund" button to access the same screen as the picture above.

{% hint style="info" %}
When selecting the stake amount, ensure that the remaining balance (after deducting the stake amount and fee) meets or exceeds the **Existential Deposit (ED)** requirement.&#x20;

Additionally, make sure your stake amount meets or exceeds the **minimum active stake level**. Find minimum active stake information[ here](../earning-information.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In the right corner of the screen, the system will display the step-by-step process for completing the stake, which you need to follow to successfully finish the process.

{% endhint %}

From this step, **two scenarios** can occur.

#### If you already have enough DOT on Acala network

In this case, you can skip to **Step 5** to continue the process and there are not any additional steps.

#### If you do not have/not have enough DOT on Acala network&#x20;

Then you will have to do one more step to XCM (cross-transfer) DOT from Polkadot to Acala network.

**Step 4:** A pop-up window will appear. Check the information carefully and then click "Approve" to proceed.

Please note that you need to pay the XCM transaction fee in DOT.
{% endhint %}

**Step 5**: You have successfully transferred your DOT from Polkadot to Acala!

Now choose "Continue" to mint your LDOT.

### If you are in "Single account" mode.

In "Single account" mode, most steps are identical to "All account" mode. The only difference is that in step 2 you would not have to select the account.

&#x20;The screen would be as the following image:
