We also identify destroyed/ inactive pools. **We suggest that you always choose an active pool to stake with**.&#x20;

To filter out the active pool, click the fader icon on the right-hand side of the search validator bar. Choose the "Active" checkbox and click "Apply filter".&#x20;

After choosing the pool, please make sure that the amount you want to stake is at least equal to or greater than the pool's minimum staking required.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For **Polkadot nomination pool**, the minimum active stake is 1 DOT.

Please keep in mind that each network has regulations regarding the **existential deposit** **(ED)**. When selecting the stake amount, it is important to ensure that the balance (after reducing the stake amount and stake fee) is equal to or greater than **ED**.
