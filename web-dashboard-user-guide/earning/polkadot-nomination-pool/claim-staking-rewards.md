{% hint style="info" %}
In this case, we are in all accounts mode. If you are already in a single account mode, you would not have to go through Step 3.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You will notice that once an account is chosen, the reward amount will be automatically filled in.&#x20;

This is because the amount of rewards available for claiming has been determined before, by the protocol and by the unstaking action you had previously performed in the past.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Here, we provide you with a â€œBond reward after claim" option.

When you select this option, your rewards will be automatically staked into the pool after claiming. It means the rewards will be added to your locked balance, also known as active staked.

If you don't select this option, the rewards will be added to your transferable balance.
{% endhint %}

Click "Continue" to proceed with the action.
