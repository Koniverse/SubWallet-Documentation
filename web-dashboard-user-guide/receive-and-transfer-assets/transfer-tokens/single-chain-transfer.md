# Single-chain transfer

{% hint style="info" %}
"Single-chain transfer" refers to the process of transferring tokens within the same blockchain network. It does not involve moving assets across different blockchains.
{% endhint %}

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet homepage and click the "Send" button.

You will be directed to a transaction request screen.

## **If you are in Single-account mode**

**Step 2:** Enter the information for the transaction and click the "Transfer" button.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In this new version of SubWallet, we introduced a new feature: Address book.&#x20;

This feature would save you a lot of time when entering the address for transaction.&#x20;

By clicking the book icon on the right-hand side of the address field, you will be directed to a list of addresses including the addresses of your accounts and other addresses (contacts) you have manually saved before.

{% endhint %}

**Step 3**: Check your transaction details, then click "Approve" if you want to proceed.&#x20;

**Step 4**: Transaction result is in.

You can either go back to the homepage or view the "receipt" of your transaction in the transaction history.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you click "View transaction", the wallet will show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Please remember that the receive record and the send record must have identical extrinsic hash.

{% endhint %}

## **If you are in "All accounts" mode**

{% hint style="info" %}
In "All accounts" mode, most transaction steps are identical to the "Single-account mode". The only additional step that users need to perform is selecting the sender.
