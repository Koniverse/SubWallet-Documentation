# Cross-chain transfer

{% hint style="info" %}
Cross-chain transfer refers to the process of transferring assets between different blockchains for enhanced collaboration and decentralized exchange.

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet web dashboard homepage and click the "Send" button.

You will be directed to a transaction request screen.

## **If you are in Single-account mode**

**Step 2:** Enter the information for the transaction.

To make a **cross-chain transfer**, click on "Select destination chain".

Next, choose the chain you want to transfer tokens to.

Enter the amount and the recipient's address, then click "Transfer".

A complete transaction request will look as follows:

{% hint style="info" %}
In this new version of SubWallet, we introduced a new feature: Address book.&#x20;

This feature would save you a lot of time when entering the address for transaction.&#x20;

By clicking the book icon on the right-hand side of the address field, you will be directed to a list of addresses including the addresses of your accounts and other addresses (contacts) you have manually saved before.

{% endhint %}

**Step 3**: Check your transaction details carefully, then click "Approve" if you want to proceed.&#x20;

**Step 4**: Transaction result is in.

You can either go back to the homepage or view the "receipt" of your transaction in the transaction history.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you click "View transaction", the wallet will show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.&#x20;

Please remember that the receive record and the send record must have identical extrinsic hash.
{% endhint %}

## **If you are in "All accounts" mode**

{% hint style="info" %}
In "All accounts" mode, most transaction steps are identical to the "Single-account mode". The only additional step that users need to perform is selecting the sender.
