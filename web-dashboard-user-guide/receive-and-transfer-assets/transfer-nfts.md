{% hint style="info" %}
Please notice the chain in which you have the NFT, because you could only send an NFT to an account that is of the same type as the chain. In this example, the NFT is on the Kusama chain - a Substrate chain, so you know that the receiving account must be a Substrate account.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Step 4**: Enter the receiving account address. Since we are sending an NFT that exists on Kusama, you would need to enter a Substrate account. Then click "Next".

The image below is an example of a complete input:

{% hint style="info" %}
In this new version of SubWallet, we introduced a new feature: Address book.&#x20;

This feature would save you a lot of time when entering the address for a transaction.&#x20;

By clicking the book icon on the right-hand side of the address field, you will be directed to a list of addresses including the addresses of your accounts and other addresses (contacts) you have manually saved before.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

**Step 5**: Check the transaction details and click "Approve" to proceed.

**Step 6**: Transaction result is in!

You can either go back to the homepage or view the "receipt" of your transaction in the transaction history.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you click "View transaction", the wallet will show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.&#x20;

Please remember that the receive and send records must have identical extrinsic hash.
