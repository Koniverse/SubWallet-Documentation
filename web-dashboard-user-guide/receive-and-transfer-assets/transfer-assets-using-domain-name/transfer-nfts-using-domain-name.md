# Transfer NFTs using domain name

The action of transferring NFTs using a domain name is almost identical to the action of transferring NFTs using a normal wallet address. The only difference is that instead of filling it with a normal wallet address you can enter the domain name of the recipient's account.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that when using a domain name, you do not need to remember the full wallet addresses. Instead, you simply need to enter the domain name that the recipient has registered. The system will automatically detect the registered wallet address associated with that domain name.
{% endhint %}

Here is an example of a transaction using a domain name:
