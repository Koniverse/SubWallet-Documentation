# Transfer assets using domain name

{% hint style="info" %}
Using a domain name in transactions brings several benefits to users. Now, users no longer need to enter long and hard-to-remember wallet addresses. Instead, they can enter the registered domain name of the recipient, and the system will detect the corresponding wallet address. This simplifies the process, reduces errors, and improves the user experience.

{% hint style="info" %}
Up until now, SubWallet has only supported the domain name feature in Aleph Zero. We are working on expanding this feature to other networks and will keep you updated.
