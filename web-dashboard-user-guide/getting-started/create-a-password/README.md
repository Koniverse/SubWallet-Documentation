# Create a password

At the start of your journey with us, we always ask you to create a password (such as when you [create a new account](../../account-management/create-a-new-account.md) or [import an existing account](../../account-management/import-an-account.md)).

Once applied, you can also [change your password](change-password.md) if you so wish. Please note that you will need your current password to confirm the change.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to change your password, you would need to remember your old password. This function cannot help you if you forget your password and want to restore it.&#x20;

If you forgot or lost your password, you would need to [import the account](../../account-management/import-an-account.md) again with seed phrase, private key, or QR code, and then set up a new password.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Last but not least, the password would allow you to [lock and unlock your wallet](../lock-and-unlock-your-wallet/) if you so wish.&#x20;
