# Change password

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that SubWallet is non-custodial, so you would be the only person who knows your password; we cannot help you restore your password once it is lost.&#x20;

Please make sure that your password is well-kept.&#x20;

\
In order to change your password, you would need to remember your old password. This function cannot help you if you forget your password and want to restore it.&#x20;
