If you have an account attached from Ledger in substrate network (such as Polkadot, Acala,...), it can only handle assets like tokens and NFTs within the specific network associated with that account.&#x20;

For instance: If you have an account attached from Ledger with the Polkadot network, you can only manage assets within the Polkadot network using SubWallet.

On the other hand, if you have an account attached from Ledger in EVM networks (such as Moonbeam, Ethereum,...), it can active and manage all of the assets on EVM network.
