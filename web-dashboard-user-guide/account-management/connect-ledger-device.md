{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a Ledger account on the Substrate network (e.g., Polkadot, Acala, etc.), it is limited to handling assets within the corresponding network, such as tokens and NFTs.

For instance: If you have an account attached from Ledger with the Polkadot network, you can only manage assets within the Polkadot network using SubWallet.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
On the other hand, if you have an account attached from Ledger in EVM networks (such as Moonbeam, Ethereum,...), it can active and manage all of the assets on the EVM network.

For instance: If you have an account attached from Ledger with Moonbeam network, you also can manage assets from Ethereum,... within the EVM network using SubWallet.
