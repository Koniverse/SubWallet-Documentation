Your new account will be automatically created and added to the account list.&#x20;

You could also derive a new account from the details section of a particular account. In this case, you would not have to go through Step 3 in the above instruction.&#x20;

\
From Step 2, if you choose the configuration button (the pencil icon next to a particular account), you will be directed to an account details section. You could then choose the "Derive account" option in this section.&#x20;
