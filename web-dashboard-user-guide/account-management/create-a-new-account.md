# Create a new account

### If this is the first time you install SubWallet

**Step 1**: Open [SubWallet's web dashboard](https://web.subwallet.app/welcome), at the welcome page, choose "Create a new account".

**Step 2:** Create a password and click "Continue".

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that SubWallet is non-custodial, so you would be the only person who knows your password; we cannot help you restore your password once it is lost. Please make sure that your password is well-kept.
{% endhint %}

**Step 3:** Keep your recovery phrase (also known as seed phrase or secret phrase) in a safe place.&#x20;

This recovery phrase is as important as your private key; if someone has your recovery phrase, they will have full control of your account.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If, for instance, you forget your password, you will need your recovery phrase to import the account again and set up a new password.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In the Homepage, if you click the account name, you will see your list of accounts. You can switch & select your accounts here. We also offer the "All accounts" mode in case you need a quick glance at your total assets.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

For each seed phrase created with SubWallet, you would have a Substrate account and an EVM account. Substrate account would display your assets on Substrate-native blockchains (such as Polkadot, Kusama, and Acala), while EVM account would display your assets on EVM chains (such as Moonbeam).&#x20;
