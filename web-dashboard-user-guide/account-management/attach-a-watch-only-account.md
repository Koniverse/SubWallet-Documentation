# Attach a watch-only account

This feature allows you to view an account you do not own (i.e do not have private key for) with SubWallet. All you need is an account address.

### If you have not had any accounts with SubWallet

**Step 1:** Open [SubWallet's web dashboard](https://web.subwallet.app/welcome), at the welcome page, enter the wallet address (as known as public key) of the account you want to track. Then click the "Add watch-only wallet" button below.

**Step 2:** You need to create a password and click "Continue".

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that SubWallet is non-custodial, so you would be the only person who knows your password; we cannot help you restore your password once it is lost. Please make sure that your password is well-kept.
{% endhint %}

**Step 3:** You have successfully added the watch-only account to your wallet! Click "Go to portfolio" to be re-directed to the homepage.

**Step 4:** This is the homepage where you can view and track the funds of the account. As the name suggests, this type of account is watch-only. You would not be able to transfer funds or actively participate in any activities with this type of account.&#x20;

In this example, your watch-only account has been named "Account 1". You can rename it as you wish by clicking the edit icon on the right-hand side. Then, replace the name you want to change in the "Account name" field.

SubWallet helps you identify your watch-only accounts with the eye symbol as shown in the picture above, so even if you are creative when naming this account, you can still identify it. Please make sure that you are not in a watch-only account if you want to make transactions.
