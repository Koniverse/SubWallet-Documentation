Click the "Go to Setting" button. You will be directed to our security settings screen. Please switch the toggle and approve the browser pop-up to enable camera access.

If you use the Brave browser, there will be multiple options that allow us to access the camera for different durations. You can choose the time option that best fits your personal preferences. However, to ensure a seamless experience with our system, we recommend selecting the "forever" option.
