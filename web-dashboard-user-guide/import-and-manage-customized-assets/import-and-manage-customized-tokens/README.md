There is also another way to quickly access the Manage tokens setting.

First, scroll down to the end of the homepage.&#x20;

Then, click on the "Manage tokens" button.

**Step 4**: Enter the required information. You would need to specify the network you have the token on, and the contract address corresponding with that token. Then click "Import token".

**Step 5**: After the token is successfully imported, we will redirect you to the token list. You can search for the token name on the search bar and the token you have just imported should be found.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that we do not ACTIVELY support your manually imported tokens; therefore, if you engage in transactions such as sending and receiving these tokens, we will show you the exact responses from the contract specified by the contract address that you have provided.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

We are happy to support you with any issues you have via [Discord](https://discord.gg/CvVewvApry) and [Telegram](https://t.me/subwallet), but please note that our developers do not have full knowledge of your manually imported tokens.&#x20;



## Manage your customized tokens

{% hint style="info" %}
Since our natively supported tokens are used by a larger user base, we prioritize our natively supported token over the user's manually imported tokens. As a result, it might be difficult to find your customized tokens in our token list.&#x20;

A useful trick is to utilize the "Search" feature every time you want to use the customized tokens.&#x20;

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet homepage and enter your customized token name in the search bar.

**Step 2**: After entering the token name, your customized token will appear below. Now you need to click on it.

**Step 3**: You will be directed to a token screen. You could now send or get the address to receive this token without having to find it in a long token list. Pretty neat, isn't it?

{% hint style="info" %}
SubWallet is currently supporting more than 490 tokens, including cross-chain tokens.

To send token, you might want to read the instruction [here](../../receive-and-transfer-assets/transfer-tokens/).&#x20;

To receive token, you might want to read the instruction [here](../../receive-and-transfer-assets/receive-tokens-and-nfts.md#receive-tokens).

{% hint style="info" %}
Since you have already selected your token, there will be fewer steps than there are in the instructions.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
