**Step 2**: A window will pop up. Here, you need to enter the NFT details.&#x20;

You would need to specify the network you have the NFT on and the specific contract address. Then click "Import".

SubWallet would automatically perform an on-chain search to fill in other details such as NFT type and NFT collection name.&#x20;

This is an example of a complete transaction:

**Step 3**: You will be redirected back to the NFT home screen. Your newly imported NFT (in this case, "NFT") should be visible there.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that one of the accounts you are managing with SubWallet must be the owner of the NFT. If you import an NFT you do not own (even though you know the network and the contract address), or if you are not managing the NFT owner account with SubWallet, the NFT will not appear in SubWallet.&#x20;
