# Security

## 1. Non-Custodial Wallet

Only you have access to your accounts, funds, private keys & data because SubWallet is a non-custodial wallet. It generates passwords and keys on your device & never share them with anyone.

## 2. Respected User Privacy&#x20;

SubWallet does not track any personal identifiable information, your account addresses or asset balances. Check our [Privacy Policy](https://subwallet.thememove.com/v2/privacy-policy.html).

## 3. Independent Audit Verification

SubWallet has officially passed Verichains’ security audit. With this breakthrough verification, users can trust that SubWallet is a safe extension worthy of their time, effort, and investment. Check our [Certification](https://bit.ly/3MU105s).

## 4. Fully Open Source

SubWallet is an open-source project that tends to be more flexible because we respond more rapidly to market demands. SubWallet’s control system allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the integrity of the original project. Check our [Github Repository](https://github.com/Koniverse/SubWallet-Extension)**.**

## 5. Cold Wallet Support

For now, SubWallet supports connecting [Polkadot Vault](../extension-user-guide/account-management/attach-a-polkadot-vault-previously-parity-signer-account.md), [Ledger](../extension-user-guide/account-management/connect-ledger-device/) and [Keystone](../extension-user-guide/account-management/connect-keystone-device.md) to SubWallet to better secure your asset. You can find the guidance in our User guide.&#x20;

## 6. Phishing Prevention

We have integrated phishing lists from Polkadot {.js} and ChainPatrol to protect you from scams. So when our users access a site that is detected as a scam, they will see a notification about that. This will help their accounts and assets be more secure.
