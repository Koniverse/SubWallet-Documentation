You can see transaction history in both All accounts mode and single account mode. If you want to see the history of a specific account, simply switch to a single account mode and only transactions in such an account will be displayed as the example below.&#x20;

To switch between these modes, please follow [this guide](account-management/switch-between-accounts-and-change-account-name.md).
