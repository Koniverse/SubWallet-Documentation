# Single-chain transfer

{% hint style="info" %}
"Single-chain transfer" refers to the process of transferring tokens within the same blockchain network. It does not involve moving assets across different blockchains.
{% endhint %}

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet homepage and click the Send button.

You would be directed to a transaction request screen.

## **If you are in Single-account mode**

**Step 2:** Enter the information for the transaction and click the "Transfer" button.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In this new version of SubWallet, we introduced a new feature: Address book.&#x20;

This feature would save you a lot of time when entering address for transaction.&#x20;

By clicking the book icon on the right hand side of the address field, you would be directed to a list of addresses including: the addresses of your accounts and other addresses (contacts) you have manually saved before.

To manage your address book, please follow this [guide](../../manage-address-book.md)
{% endhint %}



**Step 3**: Check your transaction details, then click "Approve" if you want to proceed.&#x20;



**Step 4**: Transaction result is in.

You can either go back to homepage or view the "receipt" of your transaction in the transaction history.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you click "view transaction", the wallet would show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In this case, as we are sending to an account also managed by SubWallet, there would be two (2) records correspond with this action: one is a send record from "Phoebe" to "SubWallet" and the other is a receive record of "SubWallet" from "Phoebe".&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you click the "View transaction" button, SubWallet would display the receive record, because it was recorded after the send record.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (58) (1) (1).png>)

However, in the History tab, you would see both records and their extrinsic hash should be identical. To get to the transaction history tab, please follow this [guide](../../view-transaction-history.md).

## **If you are in "All accounts" mode**

{% hint style="info" %}
In "All accounts" mode, most transaction steps are identical to the "Single-account mode". The only additional step that users need to perform is selecting the "Sender".
