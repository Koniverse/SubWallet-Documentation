# Apply master password

If you have been using the beta version of SubWallet extension wallet, when updating to the new official version, SubWallet would ask you to create and apply a master password to your existing accounts.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In this updated version, with the introduction of a master password, users would not have to enter password with every transaction like the way it was in the beta version of the wallet.&#x20;

You could also lock and unlock your wallet with the master password.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Step 1**: Click "Create master password"

This will be the first screen in our new version.

**Step 2**: Choose a master password. Please remember your password because we could not help you restore it once lost.&#x20;

Then click "Continue"

**Step 3**: Click "Apply master password" to apply your newly created master password to the accounts you are managing with SubWallet.&#x20;

**Step 4**: Enter your old password for each account and click "Next" to confirm the change

{% hint style="info" %}
You would need your old password for each account to confirm the change.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In this example, we are managing 3 accounts with the SubWallet beta version, so we would need to manually enter old password 3 times.&#x20;

It can be tedious if you have many accounts with SubWallet, but this is the most secure way to let SubWallet know that it is you who is making the change.&#x20;

**Step 4**: Click "Finish" and you have successfully updated your password.&#x20;
