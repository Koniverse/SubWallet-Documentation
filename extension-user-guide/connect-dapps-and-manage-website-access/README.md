# Connect DApps & manage website access

### **Connect dApps**

**Step 1**: Launch the dApps and find the "Connect Wallet" button.&#x20;

In this example, we are using Beamswap.

</div>

**Step 2**: After clicking "Connect Wallet", you would see various wallet option. Choose SubWallet.

</div>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that sometimes extension wallets might override each other and thus create issues while connecting. We would suggest you disable other extension wallets if you wish to proceed the action with SubWallet.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



**Step 3**: A pop-up would appear. Please choose the account you want to connect and click the "Connect" button.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that you can check connect status right in wallet's homepage by moving or scrolling the mouse to the Connecting symbol on the left corner:&#x20;

If it turns green, then you're successfully connected.

If the Connecting symbol remains grey, it indicates an unsuccessful connection. In that case, you may need to double-check your connection settings.

### Manage websites access

After successfully connecting to dApps, you can manage the connected dApps/websites with your wallet by following these steps:

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet and click on the list item on the upper left corner to get to Settings section.

**Step 4**: You would see a list of websites connected with SubWallet and the corresponding number of accounts connecting.&#x20;

Click on the website you want to change access. In this case we use Beamswap as an example:

In this case, we are connecting to Beamswap using 1 account (Arrange - EVM). You could manually enable/disable access to this website by switching the toggle corresponding to each account.&#x20;

Furthermore, if you click on the gear icon on the upper right corner of the screen, there are other options such as disconnect all, connect all, forget site and block site. We think this feature would be useful if you manage a large number of accounts and a large number of dApps.&#x20;
