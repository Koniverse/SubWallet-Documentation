# Add new tokens unavailable in pre-defined list from DApp

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, SubWallet only supports adding new tokens that adhere to the ERC-20 and PSP-22 standards.

**Step 1**: Open the dApp, then connect the dApp to SubWallet.

In here, we are using Astar Portal as an example.

If you have successfully connected with your wallet, your wallet address will be displayed as follow:
