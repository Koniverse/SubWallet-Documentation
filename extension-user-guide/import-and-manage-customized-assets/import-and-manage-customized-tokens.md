**Step 4**: Enter required information. You would need to specify the chain you have the token on, and the contract address corresponding with that token. Then click "Import".

**Step 5**: After the token is successfully imported, we would redirect you to the token list. You can search for the token name on the search bar and the token you have just imported should be found.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that we do not ACTIVELY support your manually imported tokens; therefore, if you engage in transactions such as sending and receiving of these tokens, we would show you the exact responses from the contract specified by the contract address that you have provided.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

We are happy to support with any issues you have via [Discord](https://discord.gg/CvVewvApry) and [Telegram](https://t.me/subwallet), but please note that our developers would not have full knowledge of your manually imported tokens.&#x20;



## Manage your customized tokens

{% hint style="info" %}
Since our natively supported tokens are used by a larger user base, we prioritize our natively supported token over user's manually imported tokens. As a result, it might be difficult to find your customized tokens in our token list.&#x20;

An useful trick is to utilize the "Search" feature everytime you want to use the customized tokens.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet homepage and click the "Search" item on the top right corner.

**Step 2**: Find your customized token name in the search bar and click on it.

**Step 3**: You will be directed to a token screen. You could now send or get the address to receive this token without having to find it in a long token list. Pretty neat, isn't it?

{% hint style="info" %}
SubWallet is currently supporting more than 490 tokens, including cross-chain tokens.&#x20;

To send token, you might want to read the instruction [here](../receive-and-transfer-assets/transfer-tokens/).

To receive token, you might want to read the instruction [here](../receive-and-transfer-assets/receive-tokens-and-nfts.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Since you have already selected your token, there would be less steps than there are in the instructions.&#x20;
