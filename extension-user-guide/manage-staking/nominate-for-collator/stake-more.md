In the above example, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are already in a single account mode, you would not have to select an account. Your staking request form would be like the following image:

We suggest you pay close attention to the pool you are choosing. When selecting pool, SubWallet support you with the latest record of pool details. Please click the three-dot icon on the right hand side of each pool to see the pool details.
