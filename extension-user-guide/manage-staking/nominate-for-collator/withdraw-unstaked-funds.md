# Withdraw unstaked funds

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet and choose the Staking tab.&#x20;

Then click the three-dot item on the right-hand side of the stake you want to withdraw to see all the available options.

{% hint style="info" %}
SubWallet automatically enables the "Withdraw" option if your unstaked period is due. If you check the available actions and see that some of the actions such as withdraw and claim rewards are not available, it might be the case that your unstaking period has not been due yet, or that the protocol you are staking for is not allowing those options.&#x20;

In any case, we are happy to support you via [Discord](https://discord.gg/CvVewvApry) and [Telegram](https://t.me/subwallet).&#x20;

**Step 3**: Choose the account for withdrawal.

If you wish to proceed with the action, click "Continue".

{% hint style="info" %}
You will notice that once an account is chosen, the withdrawal amount will be automatically filled in.&#x20;

This is because the amount of funds available for withdrawal has been determined before, by the protocol and by the unstaking action you had previously performed in the past.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In this example, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are in a single-account mode, you would not have to go through Step 3.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



**Step 4**: Confirm withdrawal by clicking the "Approve" button.&#x20;

If you click "view transaction", the wallet will show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.

You can see your staking withdrawal transaction in the History tab. To get to the transaction history tab, please follow this [guide](../../view-transaction-history.md).
