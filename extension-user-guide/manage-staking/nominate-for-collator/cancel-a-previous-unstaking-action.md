{% hint style="info" %}
In this example, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are in a single-account mode, you would not have to go through Step 3.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You will notice that once an account is chosen, the unstaking amount will be automatically filled in.&#x20;

This is because the unstaking action and the corresponding unstaking amount have been determined before, by the protocol and by the unstaking action you had previously performed in the past.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



**Step 4**: Confirm your action by clicking "Approve".

Note that you have to pay the transaction fee for canceling a previous unstake request.

You can see your staking withdrawal transaction in the History tab. To get to the transaction history tab, please follow this [guide](../../view-transaction-history.md).
