{% hint style="info" %}
In this example, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are in a single-account mode, you would not have to go through Step 3.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You would notice that once an account is choosen, the unstaked amount would be automatically filled in.&#x20;

This is because the unstaking action and the corresponding unstaking amount has been determined before, by the protocol and by the unstaking action you had previously performed in the past.&#x20;
