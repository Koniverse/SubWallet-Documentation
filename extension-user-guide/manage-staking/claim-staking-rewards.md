In this case, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are already in a single account mode, you would not have to go through Step 3.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You would notice that once an account is choosen, the reward amount would be automatically filled in.&#x20;

This is because the amount of rewards available for claiming has been determined before, by the protocol and by the unstaking action you had previously performed in the past.&#x20;
