## If you want to nominate for dApp

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet and choose the Staking tab. Then click the "+" icon on the upper right corner to start staking.&#x20;

If you are in all-accounts mode like the current example, you would need to choose the staking account.&#x20;

If you have already been in a single account, you would not have to select account. Your Step 2 would be as the following image:

We suggest you pay close attention to the dApp you are choosing. When selecting pool, SubWallet support you with the latest record of dApp details. Please click the three-dot icon on the right hand side of each pool to see the pool details.

You could use the sort function to find the most suitable validator according to your need. Please click the sort icon on the upper right corner and choose your sorting criteria.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We also identify destroyed/ inactive pool. **We suggest that you always choose an active pool to stake with**.&#x20;

To filter out active pool, click the fader icon on the right hand side of the search validator bar. Then click the checkbox "Active validator".&#x20;

Step 4: Result is in!

You could see your staking transaction in the History tab.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you click "view transaction", the wallet would show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.&#x20;

Best practice to keep in mind is to always stake slightly above minimum active stake.&#x20;
