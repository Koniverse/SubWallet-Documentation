In this case, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are already in a single account mode, you would not have to go through Step 3.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You would notice that once an account is choosen, the reward amount would be automatically filled in.&#x20;

This is because the amount of rewards available for claiming has been determined before, by the protocol and by the unstaking action you had previously performed in the past.&#x20;

If you click "view transaction", the wallet would show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.&#x20;

Depending on whether or not there is an explorer service (provided by other parties) with the blockchain, SubWallet might offer the "View on explorer" option for some transactions.
