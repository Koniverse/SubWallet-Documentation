# Withdraw unstaked funds

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet and choose the Staking tab.&#x20;

Then click the three-dot item on the right hand side of the stake you want to withdraw to see all the avaliable options.&#x20;

**Step 2**: Choose the "Withdraw" option.

{% hint style="info" %}
SubWallet automatically enable the "Withdraw" option if your unstaked period is due. If you check the available actions and see that some of the actions such as withdraw and claim rewards are not available, it might be the case that your unstaking period has not due yet, or that the protocol you are staking for are not allowing those options.&#x20;

In any cases, we are happy to support you via [Discord](https://discord.gg/CvVewvApry) and [Telegram](https://t.me/subwallet).&#x20;
{% endhint %}



**Step 3**: Choose the account for withdrawal.&#x20;

You would notice that once an account is choosen, the withdraw amount would be automatically filled in.&#x20;

This is because the amount of funds available for withdrawal has been determined before, by the protocol and by the unstaking action you had previously performed in the past.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In this example, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are in a single-account mode, you would not have to go through Step 3.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
