# Stake more

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet and choose the "Staking" tab. Then click on the three-dot icon next to the stake you want to stake more for.

**Step 2**: Choose "Stake more".

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that if you nominate for validator and want to stake more, you can continue to stake for the previously selected validator or stake for a new validator. Additionally, you have the option to switch validators, which means that you can unstake from Validator A and choose a different validator to stake with.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



**Step 3**: Fill in the staking request.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the above example, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are already in a single account mode, you would not have to select an account. Your staking request form would be like the following image:

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that with validator staking you can stake more by choosing the same validator as the previously performed staking.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

An example of a completed stake more request would be the following:

If you click "view transaction", the wallet would show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.&#x20;
