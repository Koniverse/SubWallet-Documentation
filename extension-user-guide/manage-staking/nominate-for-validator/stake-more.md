Please note that if you nominate for validator and want to stake more, you can continue to stake for the previously selected validator or stake for a new validator. Additionally, you have the option to switch validators, which means that you can unstake from Validator A and choose a different validator to stake with.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



**Step 3**: Fill in the staking request.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the above example, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are already in a single account mode, you would not have to select an account. Your staking request form would be like the following image:

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that with validator staking you can stake more by choosing the same validator as the previously performed staking.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

An example of a completed stake more request would be the following:
