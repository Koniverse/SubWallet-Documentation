# Unstake

Unstake your previously staked (bonded) funds. Also known as unbonding funds.

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet and choose the Staking tab.&#x20;

Then click the three-dot item on the right hand side of the stake you want to unstake.&#x20;

**Step 2**: In the list of available actions, choose "Unstake funds".

**Step 3**: Enter the information for unstaking.&#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (755).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
In the above example, we are in "All - accounts" mode. If you are in a single-account mode, you would not have to select account to unstake. Your Step 3 would look like the following:

{% endhint %}

A complete input for unstaking would look like the following image:

In this case we are unstaking 200 TZERO from our previous bonded amount of 560.72 TZERO.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that with TZERO, the minimum active stake required is 100 (this information has been shown when you started staking), so in this case we could not unstake more than 460.72 TZERO.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To proceed with the action, click "Submit".



**Step 4**: Check your unstaking action again and click "Approve".

{% hint style="info" %}
If you click "view transaction", the wallet would show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.&#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (760).png>)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You could see your unstaking transaction in the History tab. To get to the transaction history tab, please follow this [guide](../../view-transaction-history.md).\

{% endhint %}

Depends on the network, sometimes you could still [cancel your unstaking](broken-reference) action with an amount of transaction fee.&#x20;
