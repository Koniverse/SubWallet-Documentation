**Step 3**: Fill in the staking request.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the above example, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are already in a single account mode, you would not have to select an account. Your staking request form would be like the following image:

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that since this is a "stake more" action for a previously performed staking, you might not choose a different validator. If you want to stake for another validator, you would need to start a new staking action.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

An example of a completed stake more request would be the following:

**Step 4**: Check the information and click "Approve" to confirm.

If you click "view transaction", the wallet would show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

To get to the transaction history tab, please follow this [guide](../../view-transaction-history.md).

After a successful transaction, the information in the pool details will be updated as you can see below:
