# Claim staking rewards

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet and choose the Staking tab.&#x20;

Then click the three-dot item on the right-hand side of the stake you want to withdraw to see all the available options.

{% hint style="info" %}
In this case, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are already in a single account mode, you would not have to go through Step 3.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You will notice that once an account is chosen, the reward amount will be automatically filled in.&#x20;

This is because the amount of rewards available for claiming has been determined before, by the protocol and by the unstaking action you had previously performed in the past.&#x20;

**Step 4**: Confirm the action by clicking the "Approve" button.&#x20;

If you click "View transaction", the wallet will show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.&#x20;

Depending on whether or not there is an explorer service (provided by other parties) with the blockchain, SubWallet might offer the "View on explorer" option for some transactions.
{% endhint %}

You can also see your claim reward action in the History tab. To get to the transaction history tab, please follow this [guide](../../view-transaction-history.md).
