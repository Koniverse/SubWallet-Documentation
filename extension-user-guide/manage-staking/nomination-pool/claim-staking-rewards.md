In this case, we are in "All accounts" mode. If you are already in a single account mode, you would not have to go through Step 3.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You would notice that once an account is chosen, the reward amount would be automatically filled in.&#x20;

This is because the amount of rewards available for claiming has been determined before, by the protocol and by the unstaking action you had previously performed in the past.&#x20;

Depending on whether or not there is an explorer service (provided by other parties) with the blockchain, SubWallet might offer the "View on explorer" option for some transactions.

You could also see your claim reward action in the History tab. To get to the transaction history tab, please follow this [guide](../../view-transaction-history.md).
