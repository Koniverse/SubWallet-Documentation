# Start staking

## If you want to stake in a nomination pool (Pooled staking)

{% hint style="info" %}
SubWallet is currently supporting pooled staking for Substrate blockchains.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet and choose the Staking tab. Then click the "+" icon on the upper right corner to start staking.&#x20;

**Step 2**: Choose the "Pools" tab in the "Add to Bond" screen and enter the staking information.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are in all accounts mode like the current example, you would need to choose the staking account.&#x20;

If you have already been in a single account, you would not have to select the account. Your Step 2 would be as the following image:

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We suggest you pay close attention to the pool you are choosing. When selecting pool, SubWallet supports you with the latest record of pool details. Please click the three-dot icon on the right-hand side of each pool to see the pool details.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You could use the sort function to find the most suitable pool according to your needs. Please click the sort icon on the upper right corner and choose your sorting criteria.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We also identify destroyed/ inactive pools. **We suggest that you always choose an active pool to stake with**.&#x20;

To filter out the active pool, click the fader icon on the right-hand side of the search validator bar. Then click the checkbox "Active validator".&#x20;

{% endhint %}

After choosing the pool, please make sure that the amount you want to stake is at least equal to or higher than the pool's minimum staking required.&#x20;

An example of a complete input for pooled staking would be the following image:

Click "Stake" to continue.



**Step 3**: Check the information and confirm your staking request by clicking "Approve".&#x20;

Step 4: The result is in!

You can see your staking transaction in the History tab.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you click "View transaction", the wallet will show you the latest transaction record in your transaction history which corresponds with the extrinsic hash of this action.&#x20;

You also can see pooled details by clicking on the symbol of the token you have bonded in the Staking tab.
