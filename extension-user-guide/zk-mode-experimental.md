# ZK mode (experimental)

{% hint style="info" %}
Zero Knowledge (ZK) is a method of proving knowledge without revealing the specific information. It enhances privacy and security by allowing validations without disclosing sensitive data.&#x20;

In this case, when you turn on ZK mode in SubWallet, you can transfer assets from public to private and reverse.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that the ZK mode is available for accounts that meet the following conditions:

* They are Substrate accounts.
* They have been imported using a seed phrase.

One additional note is that at any given time, users can only enable and manage ZK assets on one account only.
{% endhint %}

The guidelines include the following contents:

**Step 4:** When ZK mode is turned on, it will automatically sync assets. Please read the note carefully, keep the app open, and wait until it finishes syncing.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that at any given time, only one account can have ZK mode enabled, and ZK tokens will only be displayed in that specific account, not in any other accounts, even in the All Account mode.
{% endhint %}

## Disable ZK mode <a href="#google-chrome-brave-and-ms-edge" id="google-chrome-brave-and-ms-edge"></a>

To disable ZK mode, steps 1 and 2 will be the same as the steps to enable ZK mode. The only difference is in step 3.

In this step, you still need to click on the button next to "ZK mode" but you don't need to enter password anymore.&#x20;

After successfully disabling ZK mode, a pop-up notification will appear with the corresponding message.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that, after you disable ZK mode successfully, ZK assets will also disappear.

More than that, if you disconnect network supported this feature, it also means that you disable ZK mode.
