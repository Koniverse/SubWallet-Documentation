**Step 2**: Create a master password and click "Continue".

Please note that SubWallet is non-custodial, so you would be the only person who know your password; we cannot help you restore password once it is lost. Please make sure that your password is well-kept.

**Step 3**: Keep your recovery phrase (also known as seed phrase or secret phrase) in a safe place.&#x20;

This recovery phrase is as important as your private key; if someone has your recovery phrase, they will have full control of your account.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If, for instance, you forget your password, you would need your recovery phrase to import the account again and set up a new password.

For each seed phrase created with SubWallet, you would have a Substrate account and an EVM account. Substrate account would display your assets on Substrate-native blockchains (such as Polkadot, Kusama, Acala), while EVM account would display your assets on EVM chains (such as Moonbeam).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that in order to see your assets, your would need to manually enable the networks you want to use & have assets on. Please follow [this instruction](../customize-your-networks.md) to enable the networks you want to use.

SubWallet automatically enable Polkadot & Kusama networks for Substrate accounts, but you can disable them if you so wish.&#x20;
