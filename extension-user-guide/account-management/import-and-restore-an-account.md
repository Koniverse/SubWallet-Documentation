**Step 3:** Create a master password and click "Continue".

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that SubWallet is non-custodial, so you would be the only person who knows your password; we cannot help you restore your password once it is lost. Please make sure that your password is well-kept.
{% endhint %}

## Import from seed phrase

After following this [guide](broken-reference) to choose your preferred way to import an account, if you want to import by seed phrase, please enter your seed phrase and click "Import account".&#x20;

You could choose between importing either Substrate (Polkadot) account or EVM (Ethereum) account, or both.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For each seed phrase created with SubWallet, you would have a Substrate account and an EVM account.&#x20;

Substrate account would display your assets on Substrate-native blockchains (such as Polkadot, Kusama, and Acala), while EVM account would display your assets on EVM chains (such as Moonbeam).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (98) (1) (1) (1).png>)

In some cases, if you import an account from seed phrase, problems can arise if the seed phrase of your original wallet is not compatible with SubWallet.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Trust Wallet and Safepal are among the wallets not compatible with us.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In this case, we would suggest you create a new wallet account with SubWallet and transfer your assets from your original wallet to this new account.&#x20;

After importing the new account into the wallet, you might want to change the account name. Please follow this [guide](switch-between-accounts-and-change-account-name.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that in order to see your assets after importing your account, you would need to manually enable the networks you want to use & have assets on. Please follow [this instruction](../customize-your-networks.md) to enable the networks you want to use.

Ethereum network will be automatically turned on for EVM accounts.

SubWallet automatically enables Polkadot & Kusama networks for Substrate accounts, but you can disable them if you so wish.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Import by private key (currently supported with EVM account)

After following this [guide](broken-reference) to choose your preferred way to import an account, if you want to import by private key, please enter your private key and click "Import account".
