# Attach a watch-only account

This feature allows you to view an account you do not own (i.e do not have private key for) with SubWallet. All you need is an account address.

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet and click on the account name to get to the list of your accounts. Then click on the attach account item in the lower right corner

**Step 2**: Choose "Attach watch-only account"

**Step 3**: Enter the address (as known as public key) of the account you want to track. Then click "Attach watch-only account"

**Step 4**: You would be re-directed to the homescreen. In this example, your watch-only account has been named "Account 7"

As the name suggest, this type of account is read-only. You would not be able to transfer funds or actively participate in any activities with this type of account.&#x20;

If you open your list of accounts again (see step 1), you would see your watch-only account and can [rename](broken-reference) it as you wish.

{% hint style="info" %}
SubWallet helps you identify your watch-only accounts with the eye symbol as shown in the picture above, so even if you are creative when naming this account, you can still identify it. Please make sure that you are not in a watch-only account if you want to make transactions.
