# Customize your end-point (provider)

In some cases, the wallet might appear slow or fail to settle transactions. A possible cause is that the endpoint / provider fails to respond. \
Users can manually change provider with SubWallet.&#x20;

**Step 1**: Open SubWallet and click on the list item on the upper left corner to get to Settings section.
