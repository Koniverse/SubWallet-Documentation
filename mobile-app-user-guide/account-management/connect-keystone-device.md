After importing the new account into the wallet, you might want to change the account name. Please follow this [guide](switch-between-accounts-and-change-account-name.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that in order to see your assets after importing your account, you would need to manually enable the networks you want to use & have assets on. Please follow [this instruction](../customize-your-blockchains.md) to enable the networks you want to use.

SubWallet automatically enables Polkadot & Kusama networks for Substrate accounts, but you can disable them if you so wish.&#x20;
