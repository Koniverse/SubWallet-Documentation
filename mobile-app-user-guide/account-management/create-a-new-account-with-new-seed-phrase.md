## Create account with new Seed phrase

**Step 1**: SubWallet would present you with a totally new seed phrase. Please keep it in a safe place. Then click "Continue".

This recovery phrase is as important as your private key; if someone has your recovery phrase, they will have full control of your account.&#x20;

If, for instance, you forget your password, you would need your recovery phrase to import the account again and set up a new password.

Afer importing the new account into the wallet, you might want to change the account name. Please follow this [guide](switch-between-accounts-and-change-account-name.md).

For each seedphrase created with SubWallet, you would have a Substrate account and an EVM account. Substrate account would display your assets on Substrate-native blockchains (such as Polkadot, Kusama, Acala), while EVM account would display your assets on EVM chains (such as Moonbeam).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that in order to see your assets after importing your account, your would need to manually enable the networks you want to use & have assets on. Please follow [this instruction](../customize-your-blockchains.md) to enable the networks you want to use.

SubWallet automatically enable Polkadot & Kusama networks for Substrate accounts, but you can disable them if you so wish.&#x20;
