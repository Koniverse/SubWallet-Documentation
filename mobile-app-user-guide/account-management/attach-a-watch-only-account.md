# Attach a watch-only account

**Step 5**: You have successfully added the watch-only account to your wallet! In this example, your watch-only account has been named "Account 5".

As the name suggests, this type of account is watch-only. You would not be able to transfer funds or actively participate in any activities with this type of account.&#x20;

If you open your list of accounts again (see Step 1), you will see your watch-only account. You can rename it as you wish by clicking the edit icon on the right-hand side.

{% hint style="info" %}
SubWallet helps you identify your read-only accounts with the eye symbol as shown in the picture below, so even if you are creative when naming this account, you can still identify it. Please make sure that you are not in a watch-only account if you want to make transactions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that in order to see your assets after importing your account, you would need to manually enable the networks you want to use & have assets on. Please follow [this instruction](../customize-your-blockchains.md) to enable the networks you want to use.

SubWallet automatically enables Polkadot & Kusama networks for Substrate accounts, but you can disable them if you so wish.&#x20;
