# Create, apply & change master password

At the start of your journey with us, we always ask you to create a master password (such as when you [create a new account](../account-management/create-a-new-account-with-new-seed-phrase.md) or [import and restore an existing account](../account-management/import-restore-an-account.md)).&#x20;

If you have been using the beta version of SubWallet extension wallet, when updating to the new official version, SubWallet would ask you to create and apply a master password to your existing accounts.&#x20;

If you have already used the beta version of SubWallet before and are migrating to the new version, we would ask you to create and apply master password to your existing accounts. Please read the corresponding guide to see if it correctly describes your situation.

Once applied, you can also [change your master password](create-apply-and-change-master-password.md#change-master-password) if you so wish. Please note that you would need your current master password to confirm the change.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to change password, you would need to remember your old password. This function cannot help you if you forget your password and want to restore it.&#x20;

If you lose your password, you would need to [import the account](../account-management/import-restore-an-account.md) again with seedphrase, private key, or QR code, and then set up a new password.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Apply master password

After creating the master password, we would ask you to apply the newly created master password to all your accounts.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You would need your old password for each account to confirm the change.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Step 1**: Click "Apply master password" to continue.

## Change master password

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that SubWallet is non-custodial, so you would be the only person who know your password; we cannot help you restore password once it is lost.&#x20;

Please make sure that your password is well-kept.&#x20;
