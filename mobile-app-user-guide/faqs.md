### Can I use SubWallet mobile app on iOS 17?

Yes, but due to iOS 17â€™s instability, you may run into some problems. SubWallet has recorded several cases where users reported losing app data after updating to iOS 17.1, so we recommend either not updating yet or backing up your data before updating to iOS 17. We are working hard to resolve this problem. For updated information, please join our [Telegram](https://t.me/subwallet) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/vPCN4vdB8v).
