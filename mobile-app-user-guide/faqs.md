### Can I use SubWallet mobile app on iOS 17?

Yes, but due to iOS 17â€™s instability, you may run into some problems. SubWallet has recorded several cases where users reported losing app data after updating to iOS 17.1, so we recommend either not updating yet or **backing up your data** before updating to iOS 17 (see instructions below). We are working hard to resolve this problem. For updated information, please join our [Telegram](https://t.me/subwallet) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/vPCN4vdB8v).

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Nov 28, 2023 updates**</mark>: For user security and app performance, SubWallet, like many iOS apps, has been using the Apple webkit to store app data locally on the device. Therefore, app data loss can happen due to iOS 17 webkit's instability. This problem has been reported by multiple applications running on iOS and using Apple webkit for local data storage. \
We have implemented hotfixes in v1.1.11 (241) to lower the risk of losing app data, and we will continue to work on a drastic solution in the coming days.
