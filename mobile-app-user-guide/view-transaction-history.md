You can see transaction history in both All accounts mode and single account mode. If you want to see history of a specific account, simply switch to a single account mode and only transactions in such an account would be displayed as the example below.&#x20;

To switch between these modes, please follow [this guide](account-management/switch-between-accounts-and-change-account-name.md).

{% endhint %}

**Step 2**: Click on the transaction you want to view the details of. For some types of transaction (such as send transaction on mainnets), you would also have the option to view on explorer.
