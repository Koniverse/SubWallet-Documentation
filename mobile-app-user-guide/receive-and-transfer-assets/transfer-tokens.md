In this example, we are sending tokens in "All accounts" mode.&#x20;

If you are in a single-account mode, you would not have to select sending account.&#x20;

To switch between two modes, please follow this [guide](../account-management/switch-between-accounts-and-change-account-name.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
SubWallet supports both single-chain and cross-chain transfer (also known as XCM transfer or teleport). To perform XCM, you would only need to select the desired destination chain when filling in the transaction request.
