{% hint style="info" %}
If you are in all-accounts mode like the current example, you would need to choose the staking account.&#x20;

If you have already been in a single account, you would not have to select an account.
{% endhint %}

A completed unstaking request would look like the following image:

</div>

{% hint style="info" %}
You may notice that there is a **Max** option when you enter the unstake amount. Please note that **Max = Active bonded** which means that choosing the "Max" option will unstake all your currently bonded balances.

When you manually enter the amount, if the unstake amount that you input makes the remaining active stake lower than the minimum active stake, SubWallet will automatically change it to "Max".

**Step 4**: Check the information carefully and then click **Approve** to confirm unstaking.
